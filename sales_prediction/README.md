# Sales Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting future sales based on historical data using machine learning techniques. It was created as part of a course/project work.

## Introduction

In retail and business management, predicting sales accurately is crucial for planning inventory, managing resources, and overall business strategy. This project aims to build a machine learning model and deploy it using Streamlit for interactive sales prediction.

## Project Structure

- `Sales Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire project, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
  
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the required Python packages for running the project.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HIMAJA0710/machine_learning/tree/s1-b7-sales_prediction/sales_prediction
    ```
  
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open `Sales Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
  
2. Execute the notebook cells to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate it.

3. Optionally, deploy the model using Streamlit:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook or Streamlit app to interact with the sales prediction model.

## Results

The notebook and Streamlit app provide interactive visualizations and insights into:
- Predicted vs Actual Sales
- Model Performance Metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ² score)
- Feature Importance
